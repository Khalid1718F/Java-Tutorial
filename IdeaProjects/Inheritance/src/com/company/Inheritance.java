/*
In Java, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another.
We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:
Subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class.
Superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from.
To inherit from a class, use the extends keyword.
Super Class: The class whose features are inherited
is known as super class(or a base class or a parent class).
Sub Class: The class that inherits the other class is known as sub class
(or a derived class, extended class, or child class).
The subclass can add its own fields and methods in addition to the superclass fields and methods.
Reusability: Inheritance supports the concept of “reusability”, i.e. when we want to create a new class
and there is already a class that includes some of the code that we want,
we can derive our new class from the existing class. By doing this,
we are reusing the fields and methods of the existing class.
The keyword used for inheritance is extends.
